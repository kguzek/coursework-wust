### New vocabulary – examples

| Japanese                          | English               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Wrocław wa Yo-roppa arimas.       | Wrocław is in Europe. |
| Anata no ie wa doko ni arimas ka? | Where is your home?   |
| Watasi no ie wa Prusa ni arimas   | I live on Ul. Prusa   |

## New grammar

1. You cannot say `Anata wa dare des ka?` to someone face-to-face, as it carries a nuance of "you shouldn't be here". `Dare des ka?` is used for questions about someone who is not here, not someone that can hear the asker.
2. Remember to install `watasi wa dare des ka?` in your backup memory, not your main storage disk. your safe storage. it's a very tricky place to install.
3. For negation, we use `dewa arimasen` instead of `des` in "level 1 constructions" (x wa y des).
4. For higher-level constructions (2-4), we have different constructs, so the only common structures from level 1 are `<topic> wa` at the start of sentences and `... ka?` at the end of questions. They use `mas` at the end, not `des`. Negation using `dewa arimasen` is unique to level 1 constructions, because `x wa y des` is not a proper verb.
5. For level 2 construction `x is in y`, we use `x wa y ni armias`.
6. You can swap `x` and `y` as long as they are attached to their respective `wa` or `ni`, and the sentence retains its original meaning.
7. Locations are connected in descending order (largest to smallest) – i.e. in reverse compared to English.
