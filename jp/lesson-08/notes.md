## New grammar

1. `Soretomo` is **only** used for connecting available options in multiple-choice questions. It is not used as a general translation of *or*.
2. When combining sentences, you can skip repeats of the topic.
3. `Kore` can be used in relation to the speaker's body parts even if not physically touching them, since Japanese speakers consider them connected to the speaker.
4. `Sore` may be used with objects making physical contact with the speaker, even e.g. in the bloodstream, if the speaker does not want to admit the connection.
5. `Nani` is the full version of `nan`. You must use `nan` with questions like `x wa nan des ka?`.
