## New grammar

1. When referring to animate nouns, we use `imas` instead of `arimas`.
2. `Doubutsu` and `hito` are both animate nouns, while `shokubutsu` are inanimate (with the exception of "monsters" like those based on venus flytraps).
3. `Imas` is also used for ghosts and spirits, even if they don't exist.
