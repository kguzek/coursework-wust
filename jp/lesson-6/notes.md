## New grammar

| Japanese                                     | English                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Anata no daigaku wa **doko** des ka?         | What is your university?             |
| Anata no daigaku no namae wa **nan** des ka? | What is the name of your university? |

1. `Nan` is for missing objects, whereas `doko` is for missing location or institution names.
2. `Koko` is for locations around me; I don't have to be touching them. `Soko` is for things you can see. `Asoko` is for things you cannot see.
