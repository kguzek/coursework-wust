## New grammar

1. Pokemon algorithm
   - Poketo Monsta- --> PokeMon
   - Pa-sonaru Konpyu-ta- --> PasoKon
   - Maikro Kontrora- --> MaiKon
2. Solo universe: `sore` and `are` mean *that*, but `are` is "far far away" (further than `sore`). `Kore` refers to things you can touch from wherever you are located, **without moving**. `Sore` refers to things that you could touch were you to move 3-4 movements from wherever you are located (e.g. get up, and walk 2 steps). `Are` is for things situated further away.
3. Dual universe: `anata`'s `sore` space becomes `watashi`'s and `anata`'s shared `sore` space. `Kore` space is *only* for things you have physical contact with – it is no longer sufficient to be able to do so without moving. The speaker has to be touching it using a pointer (hands or legs) while speaking to be able to use `kore`. `Are` refers to things out of reach for both `watashi` and `anata`.

## Other concepts

1. `Hiragana` writing rules dictate an order of first left-to-right, and then top-to-bottom.
