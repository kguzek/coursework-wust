## New grammar

1. `Itsu` is used to fill the blank for missing time expressions.
2. Relative time expression as well as period expressions do not require verb connectors (`ni`), whereas absolute time expressions do.
3. Time periods can be combined using `no` (larger to smaller, just like with locations).
