## New grammar

1. `Kore kara` means *after this*, and analogously, `sore kara` means *after that*.
2. `O` is the object connector, used between an object and a verb.
3. For negation sentences, the `o` is replaced with `wa` and the verb is suffixed with `-en`.
4. There are two power relations to `wa` – weaker and stronger connectors, which dictate whether or not the connector *survives* negation.
   1. `Ni` is *stronger* than `wa`, so its negation becomes `niwa` (Roman empire).
      1. Other stronger connectors include `de`, `kara` and `made`.
   2. `O` is *weaker* than `wa`, so its negation becomes simply `wa` (China).
   3. `Wa` is like the Mongol empire, so when it attacks the Roman empire, both survive, but when it attacks China, China perishes.
