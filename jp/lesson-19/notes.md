## New grammar

1. `Kore kara` means _after this_, and analogously, `sore kara` means _after that_.
1. `O` is the object connector, used between an object and a verb.
1. For negation sentences, the `o` is replaced with `wa` and the verb is suffixed with `-en`.
1. There are two power relations to `wa` – weaker and stronger connectors, which dictate whether or not the connector _survives_ negation.
   1. `Ni` is _stronger_ than `wa`, so its negation becomes `niwa` (Roman empire).
      1. Other stronger connectors include `de`, `kara` and `made`.
   1. `O` is _weaker_ than `wa`, so its negation becomes simply `wa` (China).
   1. `Wa` is like the Mongol empire, so when it attacks the Roman empire, both survive, but when it attacks China, China perishes.
