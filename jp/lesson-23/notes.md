## New grammar

1. The `mo` connector belongs to the _modifier_ connector group, along with `wa`, meaning it is neither stronger nor weaker than `wa`.
   1. It is stronger than `o`, so when both are present, `mo` takes precedence.
2. It can only be applied in exact locations, not arbitrarily like in English or Polish.
3. `Ga` is used instead of `wa` when the subject is unclear.
