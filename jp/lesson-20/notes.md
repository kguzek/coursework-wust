### New vocabulary – examples

## New grammar

1. You cannot use `de` to indicate the object being driven. `De` is only for instruments, so the nuance would be the speaker is using one object to drive another.
2. In order to indicate the object being driven, we use the `no` connector.
   1. This doesn't work for all actions, only for a select few:
      1. `unten` (driving)
      2. `benkyou` (studying)
      3. `sentaku` (washing)
   2. For some actions, it may feel a bit unnatural, but it's still grammatically correct.
      1. `shokuji` (having a meal) - it indicates the occasion of the meal, not the food itself.
      2. `kaimono` (shopping) - it indicates the type of shopping, not the items being bought.
      3. `ryouri` (cooking) - it indicates the ingredient being used for cooking, not the final dish.
   3. For games and sports, you do not need to indicate the action; you can just say the name of the game or sport.
3. `Unten` refers to driving, as in controlling a vehicle, not being riding as a passenger.
4. `Go` means (spoken) language, so when combined with country names, it indicates the language of that country.
   1. Instead of `igirisu go`, you use `ei go` for English. This comes from the history between Japan and America, when the USA wanted to emphasize their independence from Britain.
