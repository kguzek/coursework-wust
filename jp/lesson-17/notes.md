### New vocabulary – examples

| Japanese                                 | English                              |

| Nani de anata wa ie ni kyou kaerimas ka? | What are you using to go home today? |

## New grammar

1. `Kyou no asa` can be shortened to `kesa`, and `kyou, no yoru` can be shortened to `kon ya`. They can be used interchangeably, even in the same conversation.
2. The short versions cannot be used in the answer when the corresponding part of the question is replaced with a template expression (i.e. `itsu`).
3. `De` is an instrument connector. It combines a used object with its user.
4. `Kaeru` can be used when returning to a previously-visited place (to return, wrócić).
