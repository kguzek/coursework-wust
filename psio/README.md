# Programowanie Strukturalne i Obiektowe

## *Structural and Object-Oriented Programming*

This directory contains the first two lab exercises which were part of S&OOP, a de-facto introduction course to Java.

> [!NOTE]
> I completed this course by presenting a fully functional Java application that used the appropriate programming paradigms (strategy, observer, polymorphism, etc.), without completing the remaining coursework.
