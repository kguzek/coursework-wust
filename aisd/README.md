# Algorithms and Data Structures

## *Algorytmy i Struktury Danych*

A test suite and solutions repository for my A&DS/DSAA list exercise & laboratory coursework. This directory contains programs written in Java used to learn various data structures and algorithms, with a particular focus on time-complexity efficiency.

## Directory structure

### List exercises

- `/dsaa.list<list number>/` – folder containing the exercises for the given list
  - `ex<exercise number>/*.java` - source code and tests for the given list exercise

### Lab exercises

- `/test.sh` – script for verifying solutions with predetermined input and output test cases
- `/dsaa.lab<exercise number>/*.java` – source code for the given laboratory exercise
- `/samples-L<exercise number>/<test number>.in` – test case input
- `/samples-L<exercise number>/<test number>.ans` – test case expected output
