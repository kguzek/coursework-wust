# Operating Systems

## *Systemy Operacyjne*

This directory contains programs written in Python as part of the OS coursework, which consisted of simulations of system processes such as task scheduling, disk I/O operations and memory paging. There is a common Python virtual environment and `requirements.txt` file in this directory as most simulations made use of the same set of dependencies.
